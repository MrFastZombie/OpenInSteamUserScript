# OpenInSteamUserScript
Simple userscript that adds a button to open Steam pages in the client.

Note: Steam now has a similar button that appears on game pages when you are not signed in. This new feature works great but if you are often signed in on your browser, you wont see it so you may still want to use this userscript. As of 5/15/2024, this userscript still works with the current version of the Steam website.

# Installation
Open the .js file and view as raw. Your Userscript manager should show a page to install. If this does not work, check if your userscript manager requires a different method to install userscripts.
